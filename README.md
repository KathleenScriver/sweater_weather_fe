Sweater Weather is a weather app designed to give the user varying degrees of information based upon the location they select. There is a section for current weather, a daily overview, an hourly forecast, as well as the 5-day forecase. The background image changes based upon the location the user puts in.

  ```
     1. https://github.com/KathleenYruegas/sweater_weather_fe.git
     2. npm install
     3. npm start (to start your server)
     ```
    You can then visit `localhost:8080` to see the site.
